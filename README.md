# cut-my-grass
webpage about services like cutting grass manual labor and debris removal

This is My project about cutting grass and also Landscapping, Debris pick up, and General labor.
I have 3+ features that i have included to meet the requirements for the front end web develpment class.
First is a css feature which is my navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes 
 switching vertically and horizontally.
 Secondly i have also used another css feature flexbox to change my picture gallery from a single column layout to a two column layout.
 Third i used javascript to show/hide my menu tabs onclick.
 I Have also included a tab that is directly linked to the owners email to email him directly from the page.
 I created a javascript array for different quotes to display on the page.

 I have also added two media queries that are designed with mobile first in mind.
